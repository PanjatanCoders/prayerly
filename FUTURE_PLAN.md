# Prayerly Future Plan

This file captures improvement ideas so we can pick them up later.

1. Stabilize localization and encoding (UTF-8 audit, ARB wiring, AppLocalizations usage across UI and services).
2. Harden notifications and audio flow (single initialization, channel cleanup, critical alert policy, schedule refresh).
3. Improve prayer time accuracy and settings (calculation methods, madhhab switch, high-latitude adjustments).
4. UX and data consistency (location flow, address lookup, settings repository, remove unused dependencies).
5. Quality and regression coverage (unit tests for services, key widget/golden tests).
